An app to combat issues of income inequality

Project Description: https://devpost.com/software/uplift-q1acr0

The API-Integration outside of the main folder is the code I used to implement the dataset with an API endpoint. Unfortunately, there was a problem with the API endpoint, so I had to switch to manually entered locations.
That file has the orignal API integration, however the rest of the UI is slightly outdated. The one in the main folder will have the code to replicate the end product.
